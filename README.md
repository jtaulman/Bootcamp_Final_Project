"Are you crying? Are you crying? ARE YOU CRYING? There's no crying! THERE'S NO CRYING IN BASEBALL!" ~Jimmy Dugan 

Sports Analysis: For Our Final Project, my role is the Trangle shape. I will create a mockup of a machine learning model. I will be the presenter of the project, and oversee everyone work to then calaborate and put all the pieces together. This will be a diagram that will explain how it will work concurrently with the rest of the project steps. 

Our Hypothesis: What Is The Hardest Pitch to Hit In Baseball? 

How my team plans to present is to use python and SQL to first analysis with storytelling then to use machine learning to determine what the probability, the percentage, the numbers and the hits that take place in a game.
