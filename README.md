# Bootcamp_Final_Project

"Are you crying? Are you crying? ARE YOU CRYING? There's no crying! THERE'S NO CRYING IN BASEBALL!" ~Jimmy Dugan (Tom Hanks) 

## Reason for Topic

The entire group had a common interest in sports and because of Spring Training and the movie Moneyball, we decided to focus on Baseball. From there we discussed different topics, but landed on this because it sparked the most curiosity for everyone. It was also an idea we all felt confident could be executed successfully.

## Questions

1. What is the hardest pitch to hit in baseball?
2. What are the odds of a batter hitting a single, double, triple or homerun off the hardest pitch?

## Project Plan

Ridvan worked on filtering the data using jupyter notebook and python. He created a filtered csv file for our current data that was used throughout the remainder of the project. Then, he helped with the remaining parts of the project.

Bryce took the filtered data and running different queries to help determine which pitch is the hardest to hit. He also joined the filtered csv's to create our final csv/database. Once completed he helped oversee the remaining parts as needed.

Jacob wrote the code for the machine learning model. The model is a SoftMax Activation model because it predicts each outcome as a probability. The model has an input of the final database and used train test split to finish building the model. Once it was built he used Flask to create a route within an index.html file. This website has a drop down menu with the pitches that when chosen reveal the probabilites as percentages. Once completed he also oversaw the remaining parts to help finish the project.

The next part of the model to be expanded is to break the hardest pitch down by left and right handed pitchers or batters. It could also be expanded by incorporating speeds and locations for each pitch.

Rachel focused on creating the final presentation along with being the primary editor for all sections of code. She created the visualizations in Tableau then copied them into our Google Slides. As a group we all looked over and edited the code, but she was the primary editor.
