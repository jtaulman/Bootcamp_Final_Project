# Bootcamp_Final_Project

For our final project, our group will be analyzing baseball data to better understand how frequent certain types of pitches are hit. Our goal is to answer two questions;

What is the hardest pitch to hit in baseball?
What is the probability of the batter hitting a single, double, triple, and homerun when the hardest pitch is thrown.
My part is to use Python to filter the data. 

# Resources
The resources we will be using are; - pitches.csv - atbats.csv Both obtained from Kaggle

And the software we will be performing our analysis on is;

Python using Jupyter notebook

SQL-PostgreSQL

Supervised Machine Learning

Linear Regression
