# Bootcamp_Final_Project

## Question

1. What is the hardest pitch to hit in baseball?
2. What are the odds of a batter hitting a single, double, triple or homerun off the hardest pitch?

## Project Plan

Ridvan will be working on filtering the data using jupyter notebook and python. He will create a filtered csv file for our current data that will be used throughout the remainder of the project. 

Bryce will be taking the filtered data and running the analysis through SQL to determine which type of pitch is the hardest to hit in baseball. Once the 1st of our project questions is answered the data will be filtered through a machine learning model.
