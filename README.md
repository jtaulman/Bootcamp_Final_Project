# Bootcamp_Final_Project

For our final project, our group will be analyzing baseball data to better understand how frequent certain types of pitches are hit. Our goal is to answer two questions;

What is the hardest pitch to hit in baseball?
What is the probability of the batter hitting a single, double, triple, and homerun when the hardest pitch is thrown.
My part is to use Python to filter the data. 

# Individual Roles in Project
Ridvan will be working on filtering the data using jupyter notebook and python. He will create a filtered csv file for our current data that will be used throughout the remainder of the project.

Bryce will be taking the filtered data and running the analysis through SQL to determine which type of pitch is the hardest to hit in baseball. Once the 1st of our project questions is answered the data will be filtered through a machine learning model.

Jacob will write the code for the machine learning model. The model being used with be a linear regression model because it will do the best to predict the batting outcome. The input of this model would be the hardest pitch data, to predict the likelyhood of hitting a single.

The goal is to expand on the model and predict doubles, triples and homeruns using the machine learning model. The next part of the model to be expanded is to break the hardest pitch down by left and right handed pitchers or batters.

Rachel will be focused on creating the final presentation along with being the primary editor for all sections of code. As a group we will all look over and help to edit code, but she will be the primary editor.

# Communication 
Slack channels and class time will be the norm of the communication for the group members about the project. 

# Resources
The resources we will be using are; - pitches.csv - atbats.csv Both obtained from Kaggle

And the software we will be performing our analysis on is;

Python using Jupyter notebook

SQLite (version TBD)

SQLAlchemy

Machine Learning

Neural Network

Softmax Activation Function
