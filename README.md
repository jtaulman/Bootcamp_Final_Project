# Bootcamp_Final_Project

## Reason for Topic

The entire group had a common interest in sports and because of Spring Training and the movie Moneyball, we decided to focus on Baseball. From there we discussed different topics, but landed on this because it sparked the most curiosity for everyone. It was also an idea we all felt confident could be executed successfully.

## Question

1. What is the hardest pitch to hit in baseball?
2. What are the odds of a batter hitting a single, double, triple or homerun off the hardest pitch?

## Project Plan

Ridvan will be working on filtering the data using jupyter notebook and python. He will create a filtered csv file for our current data that will be used throughout the remainder of the project. 

Bryce will be taking the filtered data and running the analysis through SQL to determine which type of pitch is the hardest to hit in baseball. Once the 1st of our project questions is answered the data will be filtered through a machine learning model.

Jacob will write the code for the machine learning model. The model being used with be a linear regression model because it will do the best to predict the batting outcome. The input of this model would be the hardest pitch data, to predict the likelyhood of hitting a single.

The goal is to expand on the model and predict doubles, triples and homeruns using the machine learning model. The next part of the model to be expanded is to break the hardest pitch down by left and right handed pitchers or batters.

Rachel will be focused on creating the final presentation along with being the primary editor for all sections of code. As a group we will all look over and help to edit code, but she will be the primary editor.

## Communication

We will be using SLACK and class time to communicate throughout this project.
